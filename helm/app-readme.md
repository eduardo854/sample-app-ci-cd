# Sample App CI/CD

**Sample-app-ci-cd** is an example application designed to demonstrate a complete GitOps setup using GitHub, Actions, Dockerhub, and Helm Repository.

The purpose of this example application is to showcase the entire GitOps infrastructure, including the integration of GitHub for source code management, GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), Dockerhub for container image hosting, and Helm Repository for managing Kubernetes application deployments.

By exploring this example, you can gain insights into how to set up a robust CI/CD pipeline and efficiently manage Kubernetes deployments using GitOps principles. Feel free to use this example as a reference for your own CI/CD projects and Kubernetes deployments.
